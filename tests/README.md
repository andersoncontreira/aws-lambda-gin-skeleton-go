## End-to-End Testing vs. Integration Testing
So, in a nutshell, here’s what we know about end-to-end testing vs. integration testing:

Integration Testing	End-to-End Testing
Testing to make sure app components work well together.	Testing the product as a user would experience it.
The scope could span multiple components but won’t span the entire stack most of the time.	Testing scope is wider and spans the entire application technology stack.
Done to discover connectivity issues between components when they are working together.	Done to have a feel of the user experience of the app.
Less expensive to implement.	More expensive to implement, both in terms of hardware and software.
Higher-level than unit testing.	Higher-level than integration testing.
Faster to perform.	Slower to perform.
So, Which Testing Strategy Do You Need?
By now, you may have already come to this conclusion: It’s not a question of end-to-end testing vs. integration testing, but rather E2E testing together with integration testing. Even though each type of testing takes a different approach, they share the common task of checking if the result of some code execution meets a certain expectation. And in that way, they are complementary and together can offer you the full confidence you need in your software’s performance.
